# To run Locust:
# 1. Save this file as locustfile.py in the root of your project.
# 2. Open your terminal in the project root.
# 3. Run: locust -f locustfile.py --api-base-url http://localhost:8000
#    (Replace http://localhost:8000 with your API's base URL if different)
# 4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8089 (Locust's default web UI port).
# 5. Enter the total number of users to simulate and spawn rate (users per second).
# 6. Start the test.
