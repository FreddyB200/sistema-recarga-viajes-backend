# Travel Recharge API ‚Äì Distributed Systems Lab

This project simulates a recharge system (like TransMilenio cards) using a distributed architecture with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Redis. It demonstrates caching, database logic optimization, and API development using modern Python tools.

> **Project Goal:** Build, deploy, and test a simple distributed architecture featuring:
> * **FastAPI** REST API
> * **PostgreSQL** relational database (Dockerized, setup instructions and schema in its [own repository](https://github.com/FreddyB200/travel-recharge-database.git))
> * **Redis** in-memory cache (Dockerized or local instance)

## üéØ Core Objective

Modern systems demand low-latency, high-throughput data access. This project was undertaken as part of a Distributed Systems Lab to build, deploy, and test a simple distributed architecture that addresses these needs.

The core components are:
- **PostgreSQL:** Provides data durability, consistency, and the ability to perform complex queries.
- **Redis:** Serves as an in-memory cache layer, dramatically speeding up repeated read operations (e.g., statistics, aggregates).
- **FastAPI:** Ties everything together, exposing asynchronous REST endpoints for the application logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used & Justification

- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its high performance, native `async` support, automatic data validation, and interactive API documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc), making it ideal for modern APIs and rapid development.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database, selected for its transactional integrity (ACID compliance), support for complex queries, and robust features like stored procedures.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used here as a cache to significantly reduce latency for frequently accessed, read-heavy data, thereby lessening the load on PostgreSQL.
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerizing PostgreSQL and (optionally) Redis, simplifying environment setup, ensuring consistency across different systems, and facilitating deployment.
- **VirtualBox & Alpine Linux**: The services (API, Redis, PostgreSQL) were initially deployed on separate lightweight Alpine Linux VMs within VirtualBox, communicating via a configured internal network to simulate a true distributed environment.

## üöÄ Getting Started & Setup
To get this project set up and running, including all prerequisites, database setup (which is in a separate repository), Redis setup, and API configuration:

### ‚û°Ô∏è Please refer to the detailed [DEPLOYMENT.md](deployment.md) guide.

A brief overview of tools you'll generally need: Python 3.8+, Git, Docker, and VirtualBox (for the original multi-VM setup).
---
## üî¨ Latency Testing
This project includes scripts to demonstrate and test the latency improvements achieved with Redis caching.
Note: Ensure the application environment is fully set up and the API is running as per the [DEPLOYMENT.md](deployment.md) guide before executing these tests.
### Running Latency Test Scripts
- ### For cacheable endpoints:
  ```bash
  python scripts/latency_test.py
  ```
  Follow the prompts to select the endpoint and number of iterations.

- ### For non-cacheable endpoints:
  ```bash
  python scripts/latency_non_cacheable.py
  ```
  Follow the prompts.

### Interpreting Results (Cache HIT vs. MISS)

* **Cache MISS**: The first request to a cacheable endpoint will be slower, as the API needs to query the PostgreSQL database and then store the result in Redis.
* **Cache HIT**: Subsequent identical requests will be much faster, as the data is served directly from the Redis in-memory cache.

### Example: Caching Strategy

* **What is cached?**
    Responses from aggregate endpoints that are read-heavy and whose data doesn't change with every request (e.g., `/trips/total`, `/finance/revenue`).
* **Invalidation strategy:**
    A TTL (Time To Live) is set for cached items in Redis (e.g., 300 seconds). Data expires automatically after this period, ensuring a balance between performance and data freshness.

### Latency Testing Results Examples

_This data was collected from the original test environment._

* **Cacheable Endpoints:**
    * _Endpoint: `/trips/total`_
        * First Request (Cache MISS): 57.34 ms
        * Second Request (Cache HIT): 3.2 ms
        * Third Request (Cache HIT): 6.1 ms
    * _Endpoint: `/trips/finance/revenue`_
        * First Request (Cache MISS): 62.23 ms
        * Second Request (Cache HIT): 2.55 ms
* **Non-Cacheable Endpoints (average latency):**
    * `/users/count`: 8.11 ms
    * `/users/active/count`: 9.11 ms
    * `/users/latest`: 6.69 ms

### Further Testing with Curl and Apache Benchmark (ab)

For more rigorous load testing (ensure `curl` and `apache2-utils` are installed):

1.  **Test with `curl` (single request):**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/finance/revenue
    ```
2.  **Test with `ab` (Apache Benchmark):**
    ```bash
    ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/finance/revenue
    ```
    * `-n 100`: Total requests. `-c 10`: Concurrent requests.

## üìö API Documentation & Endpoints

### Interactive API Docs

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation, accessible once the API is running:

* **Swagger UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
* **ReDoc:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

### Main Endpoints Overview

| Endpoint                | HTTP Method | Brief Description                             | Example URL (if running locally)          |
|-------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/trips/total`          | GET         | Returns the total number of registered trips. | `http://localhost:8000/trips/total`         |
| `/finance/revenue`      | GET         | Returns total revenue from recharges.         | `http://localhost:8000/finance/revenue`     |
| `/users/active/count`   | GET         | Counts active users in the system.            | `http://localhost:8000/users/active/count`  |

## üí° Lessons Learned
- **Redis from Scratch:** The journey involved more than learning syntax; it was about understanding Redis's in-memory nature, TTLs, persistence options, and its profound impact on reducing API latency for specific use cases.
- **Integrating Redis Strategically:** Realized Redis isn't just a technical add-on but a strategic component for offloading database pressure and enhancing user experience for frequently accessed, read-heavy data.
- **Value of Stored Procedures:** Implemented stored procedures in the PostgreSQL database repository to encapsulate complex business logic directly within the database, leading to optimized data operations and leaner API-side code.
- **VM Internal Networking:** Shifted from NAT to an internal network for inter-VM communication, which proved more efficient, secure for service-to-service calls, and simplified service discovery within the distributed setup.
- **Additional Challenges & Learnings:**
   - Fine-tuning Redis persistence and considering security implications.
   - Balancing cache TTLs for data freshness versus performance gains.
   - The importance of clear documentation and automatable tests to enable others (and my future self) to easily replicate results and understand the system.
